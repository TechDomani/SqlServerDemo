# Demo of calling SQL Server from C#

To get this demo to work you will need to create a database called carbon on your local sql server<br/>
You can do this using SQL Server management studio<br/>
You will then need to create a table called users<br/>
You can do this manually or run CreateUsersTable.sql in Scripts<br/>
You will then need to change the connection string in Program.cs so that the data source is set to the name of your local sql server instance<br/>
